Rasterizer2 is a pure C++ software‑rasterization demo with zero external dependencies, designed to help myself quickly grasp core graphics‑pipeline stages such as triangle rasterization, depth buffering, and texture mapping.

This project demonstrates the full rendering workflow—from loading OBJ models, performing vertex transformations, assembling triangles, edge‑function rasterization, and Z‑buffer depth testing, to applying the Phong lighting model and shadow mapping, and finally outputting TGA images

This project is still a work in progress and more functionalities will be integrated into the project going forward.
